# Desktop-Watcher

I created this script a day that I realised that my desktop was a mess.
The idea is very simple, imagine that you have a dog in your desktop, let's call him 'Choclo'.
So if Choclo see a file in your desktop, he will barks and that fille will run away.
And he will repeat this every 30 minutes.
That's the idea, as I said, it is very simple but it was fun to code.
